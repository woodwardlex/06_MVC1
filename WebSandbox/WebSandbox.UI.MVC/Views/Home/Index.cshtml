                <p>
                    Hypertext Markup Language is used to define the structure and content of a webpage. It is arguable the most important of the front-end languages as it not only provides content, but also gives CSS and JavaScript something to target.

                <p>
                    Cascade Style Sheets (CSS) is used for the formatting and layout of page content.It was introduced as a way of separating the concerns of markup (with HTML) and formatting (with CSS) into different files. CSS must target HTML in order to style it.

                    JavaScript(JS) makes web pages more interactive and allows up to provide client-side form validation. It also allows us to perform programming logic on the front end. It is written in .js files or in script tags directly in HTML.

                Lorem Ipsum
            </h2>
            <p>
                Lorem Ipsum is sample text that is often used in the mockup stage of web design before the final page copy has been written. It is used to provide filler or to show how content will layout on a page. It is typically nonsense as it's purpose is not to provide content, but rather to provide filler text. Traditionally, it has been written in Latin but they are now many online resources to create various types of lorem ipsum.
