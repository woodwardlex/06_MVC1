            <p>
                HTML enables us to mark up the content to provide it more meaning behind the scenes. This can be used by search engines, screen readers, outlining tools, and readers of our code in general. We can mark a word as an abbreviation, create lists, display code and output, create tables, mark content as quotes, and provide citations. Browsers may or may not implement standard formatting (such as a dotted underline) or standard behavior (such as a tooltip when you hover over that markup) -- but regardless, we can add our own CSS or JavaScript to ensure such things. The point of HTML isn't to get a visual effect. It's to describe and structure your content.

                    Block Level vs Inline Level Tags
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Block-level tags are designed to break up the flow of content on the page with line breaks, normally extend the entire width of their container, and are designed to contain other tags (block and inline). Inline tags do not normally break the flow of content, can contain other inline tags, and are designed to be contained inside block tags, but not to contain block elements themselves.

                        <li>

                            Article – a stand-alone content area that could even be on its own page. Typical uses would be articles, blog posts, and important self-contained topics.

                            Div – the most generic of block-level containers. Previously the go-to standard, now the last resort container.

                            Table: Designed for spreadsheet-style, tabular data, with information stored in individual cells laid out in columns and rows. Once used for page layout purposes, the adoption of CSS encourages tables to only be used grids of information for quick scanning, analysis, and comparison.

                    Semantic vs Non-Semantic Tags
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Semantic tags are intended to describe the content they contain, which is true to the generally accepted philosophy behind HTML. Examples of semantic tags would include em and strong. Examples of non-semantic tags are those that just describe the formatting of the content, like i for italic and b for bold. (These tags are a throwback to HTML before CSS was created to handle the appearance of the content.) Typically, the semantic em and strong tags, as well the non-semantic i and b tags, result in italic or bold text, respectively. But saying something looks italic only describes its appearance, whereas marking text up with an em tag means it's emphasized. If we use CSS to change the look of that emphasis (say, changing it to be green and bold), it still makes sense to leave it marked up as emphasized. But it wouldn't make sense for it to still be marked italics if that formatting had been removed. Again - use HTML to apply meaning to content rather than formatting.

                <p>
                    These are the two most common types of links. Either can be used to navigate to resources on your site. Absolute links can be used to navigate to outside resources or sites.
                    <br />
                    Here is a relative link example: <a href="index.html">Relative link to the home page</a>
                    <br />
                    Here is a root-relative exapmle: <a href="../index.html">Root-Relative link to the home page</a>
                    <br />
                    Here is an absolute link example that goes to an outside site:<a href="http://centriq.com" target="_blank">Centriq Training</a>

                </p>
                <p>
                    You can create a link to open up a new email to a specified address:
                    <a href="mailto:cnuckolls@centriq.com">cnuckolls@centriq.com</a>
                    <br />
                    Telephone links are often used in mobile applications to make a phone call:
                    <a href="tel:+01-913-322-7000">913-322-7000</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also make images clickable:
                    <a href="http://centriq.com" target="_blank">
                        <img src="images/CentriqLogo.png" />
                    </a>
